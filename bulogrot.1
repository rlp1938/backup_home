.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
\fBbulogrot\fR \- operates on the log files located at \fI$HOME/log\fR,
\fIbackup.log\fR and \fIerrors.log\fR. It renames \fIbackup.log\fR to
\fIbackup.log.0\fR, \fIbackup.log.0\fR to \fIbackup.log.1\fR and so on. Any
file \fIbackup.log.7\fR if it exists will be discarded each time the

similarly. However, if any log file is less than 4096 bytes no rotation
will done on that set.
